# Frontend




### How to run

```
yarn 

yarn start

```



### Features

For the maps, it was used the [Leaflet js](https://leafletjs.com/) library along with its React abstraction. For installation/usage:

1. Go to [leaflet quickstart](https://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start/) and copy the import of CSS
2. Go to React Leaft to follow one of [its examples](https://react-leaflet.js.org/docs/en/examples)

We're also getting the user's initial position on load. This requires that the user grants its location permission.

To get the cities and states, the API from [IBGE](https://servicodados.ibge.gov.br/api/docs/localidades?versao=1) was used.
